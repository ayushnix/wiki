Hey! I'm Ayush.

This is the homepage of my personal wiki made using [MkDocs][1] and the [Material for MkDocs][2]
theme.

I intend to use this wiki to store my notes related to Linux System Administration, DevOps,
Programming, and anything else I can think of. This wiki may contain disorganized and random
thoughts.

You may be interested in browsing my [microblog][3] where I often post short snippets about the
things I learn.

The documentation and articles in this wiki are licensed under [CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0][4]. The source code
in this wiki is licensed under [0BSD][5] if it is an original work. In cases where source code has
been copied from other sources, that source code retains its original copyright.

If you find this wiki helpful, please consider supporting me by buying me a coffee :coffee:
