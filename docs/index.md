Hey! I'm Ayush.

This is the homepage of my personal wiki made using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and the
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

I intend to use this wiki to store my notes related to Linux System Administration, DevOps,
Programming, and anything else I can think of. This wiki may contain disorganized and random
thoughts. Nonetheless, if you're browsing this wiki, I hope you find it useful.

I decided to focus more on writing a wiki instead of blog posts because

- publishing polished and well written blog posts takes time and imposes a lot of overhead which
  just made me quit before I even thought about writing something
- having my own cheatsheet and reference sounds better than desparately searching on
  Google/DuckDuckGo for answers

I'll still write blog posts but only when I find something interesting to write.

If you find this wiki helpful, please consider supporting me by buying me a coffee :coffee:
