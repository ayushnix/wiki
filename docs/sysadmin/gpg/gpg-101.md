# Introduction

Even though public key cryptography, in the form of SSH and TLS, is widely used,
[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) has always faced adoption issues among the masses due to it's
esoteric nature. In this post, I'll try to understand how GPG works, at least on a basic level and
from a bird's eye view.

When using [SSH certificates](../ssh/ssh-certificates.md), we saw public key cryptography being used

- to establish a session key for symmetric encryption to encrypt the entire SSH session
- to establish authentication by whitelisting the public key of a client on the server and the
  client presenting a signed message for the server to verify
- to establish authentication, for both the client and the server, using certificates signed by a
  certificate authority using its private key

Although it's not really required, but if you want to understand how public key cryptography works
in real use cases, you might wanna read the article on [SSH
certificates](../ssh/ssh-certificates.md), before reading this one.

# How Does GPG Work?

We can generate a set of keys using the `gpg --expert --full-gen-key` command and choosing the `(9)
ECC and ECC` option and then the `(1) Curve25519` option[^1]. The generated key pair looks something
like this

```
pub   ed25519 2021-11-03 [SC] [expires: 2022-11-03]
      DFA1BED2A6BDCAE4BE9AD8AE88A8EF325FCA2F7F
uid                      John Doe <johndoe@gmail.com>
sub   cv25519 2021-11-03 [E] [expires: 2022-11-03]
```

To get more details about the public key fingerprints,

```
$ gpg --list-keys --with-fingerprint --with-subkey-fingerprint "John Doe"
pub   ed25519 2021-11-03 [SC] [expires: 2022-11-03]
      DFA1 BED2 A6BD CAE4 BE9A  D8AE 88A8 EF32 5FCA 2F7F
uid           [ultimate] John Doe <johndoe@gmail.com>
sub   cv25519 2021-11-03 [E] [expires: 2022-11-03]
      9559 285D 3562 DEDF 0E10  18AF 33C9 FD32 63EA 96F4
```

The 160-bit hexadecimal key divided into ten groups of 4 characters each is called a **Key ID** in
`gpg` parlance. The Key ID of `John Doe <johndoe@gmail.com>`, which is the **User ID**, is

```
DFA1 BED2 A6BD CAE4 BE9A  D8AE 88A8 EF32 5FCA 2F7F
```

This key can also be identified as `88A8 EF32 5FCA 2F7F`, which is the *long form* of the Key ID.
Although you can also identify it as `5FCA 2F7F`, this 32-bit *short form* is susceptible to
[collisions](https://evil32.com/) and can't be trusted[^2].

## Master Key and Sub Keys

One of the first things that you might notice is `S`, `C`, and `E` which stand for `Sign`,
`Certify`, and `Encrypt`. However, simply expanding abbreviations doesn't really help.

When you execute `gpg --expert --full-gen-key`, you actually end up creating multiple key pairs. In
this case, GPG created two of them

- a key pair for signing data and certifying other keys
- a key pair for encrypting and decrypting data

You could create another key pair for authentication purposes as well and that would be mentioned
with an `A`. You could also split `SC` into two distinct key pairs, in which case, you'd have three
key pairs (excluding `A`).

To avoid confusion, we'll call a specific key pair the **master** key pair and all the other key
pairs as **sub keys**. By default, the key pair for performing `S` and `C` is the master key and
everything else is a sub key. If you split `S` and `C`, the `C` key pair will be the master key.
This is because the `C` key pair is the one that can be used to add or revoke sub-keys, change UIDs
and expiry date, and sign the keys of others.

You'd think that if multiple key pairs are created, how do we define a master and sub key
relationship between them? The official documentation doesn't really help in this case and, as
always, we have to dig in to the official RFCs. [RFC 4880](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880)
provides more information.

> Each Subkey packet MUST be followed by one Signature packet, which should be a sub key binding
> signature issued by the top-level key.

It looks like the master key is used to generate a "Signature packet", which binds another key pair
and makes it a sub key. Can we see the signature packet though?

``` hl_lines="12"
$ gpg --export "John Doe" | gpg --list-packets
:public key packet:
        version 4, algo 22, created 1635957635, expires 0
        keyid: 88A8EF325FCA2F7F
:user ID packet: "John Doe <johndoe@gmail.com>"
:signature packet: algo 22, keyid 88A8EF325FCA2F7F
        version 4, created 1635957635, md5len 0, sigclass 0x13
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID 88A8EF325FCA2F7F)
:public sub key packet:
        version 4, algo 18, created 1635957635, expires 0
        keyid: 33C9FD3263EA96F4
:signature packet: algo 22, keyid 88A8EF325FCA2F7F
        version 4, created 1635957635, md5len 0, sigclass 0x18
        hashed subpkt 9 len 4 (key expires after 1y0d0h0m)
        subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID 88A8EF325FCA2F7F)
```

The output is trimmed for brevity but you can see that the sub key packet has its own key ID and
it's immediately followed by a signature packet that mentions the primary key ID which is the
"issuer".

### Why Create Sub Keys?

Why create sub keys though? Why not use a single key pair for everything?

When using public key cryptography, *signing* and *encrypting* are two distinct operations. When you
sign data, you use your private key to generate a signature so that anyone who has your public key
can verify that that data was really sent from you. When you encrypt data, you use the public key of
the intended recipient to encrypt the data you want to send. The intended recipient can then use his
private key to decrypt that data.

One of the reasons why creating distinct sub keys for signing and encryption makes sense is that you
sign and decrypt data with your private key. As such, you do not want to confuse one operation for
the other, although the `gpg` prevents you from doing so by using distinct options. Another reason
why it makes sense is that if one of your sub keys, let's say your `E` sub key, is compromised, it
can be revoked and another `E` sub key can be issued. However, you do not need to prove your
identity again because the public key of `E` will still be bound to the (master) public key of `SC`.
As expected, you want to guard the private key of `SC` because that has the ultimate authority of
your identity. You do not want your master private key to get compromized.

# How is GPG Used?

This isn't gonna be a guide on actually using `gpg`, there are other guides for that, some of which
I've linked at the end of this post. Instead, we'll look at how `gpg` is used for some popular use
cases.

## Signed Git Commits and Tags

This is perhaps one of the most important use cases of `gpg` right now, signing git commits and
tags. In fact, the absence of signed tags was one the issues that Linus [pointed
out](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wjbtip559HcMG9VQLGPmkurh5Kc50y5BceL8Q8=aL0H3Q@mail.gmail.com/)
recently when the new NTFS driver was merged in the Linux kernel.

How does one really know if a commit or a tag came from the person mentioned in it? Anybody can see
the name and the email ID you've used in your commits and impersonate you. However, signed commits
and unsigned commits are different.

Here's what a signed commit looks like

``` hl_lines="6-8"
$ git log --show-signature --decorate --all

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
commit 51ab236402c276514fdfb79bbd6d0aa9e6376887 (origin/coffin, coffin) ┃

    pass-coffin is a pass extension that hides data inside a GPG coffin
```

Remember, all we've done is use our `S` private key to embed our signature in a git commit object.
This signature can be verified by anyone who has our corresponding public key. I have my public key
and so the commit is being shown as having a "Good signature" on my system. GitHub has my public key
and so it shows [this commit as
verified](https://github.com/ayushnix/awesome-password-store/commit/51ab236402c276514fdfb79bbd6d0aa9e6376887).
If you really want to see the ASCII armor signature itself, you can use `git cat-file`

``` hl_lines="6-12"

An unsigned commit wouldn't have the highlighted lines shown above. In that case, you can't really
know if they were made by the same person mentioned in the commit, especially so if the commit
wasn't made on a repository that the person doesn't own himself[^3].

[Here's](https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/bb31aaf696cddf4f35eb8d3b4823a753846ae103) another funny
example.

![Nat Friedman DMCA Commit - Dark Mode](/wiki/images/nat_dark.webp){ .dark-mode-img }
![Nat Friedman DMCA Commit - Light Mode](/wiki/images/nat_light.webp){ .light-mode-img }

In case you haven't noticed yet, the commit seems to have been made by Nat Friedman, the
[former](https://github.blog/2021-11-03-thank-you-github/) CEO of GitHub. Of course, Nat didn't
probably didn't make that commit, someone else did. This was done when the GitHub repository of
youtube-dl was taken offline due to a DMCA complaint by the RIAA and [many people weren't happy
about it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24872911). Some of them chose to express themselves
creatively I guess.

You can sign your git commits by creating a `gpg` key pair and editing your `~/.git/config` (or,
`~/.config/git/config` if you're following the XDG standard and keeping your `~` clean) to look
something like this

```
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = your@email.com
    signingkey = <your-160-bit-hexadecimal-gpg-signing-key>
[commit]
    gpgSign = true
```

You can also do it manually using `git commit --gpg-sign=<your-key-id>`.

Although `git` recently introduced [SSH keys for signing
commits](https://github.com/git/git/commit/18c6653da0be924f83415f987d76f6813b81f086) as well (in
addition to `gpg` and X.509 certificates), I feel that unless GitHub moves forward with it as well,
it may not see much adoption. Yes, GitHub does offer a setting called "[Vigilant
Mode](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-28-flag-unsigned-commits-with-vigilant-mode/)" which you
qan enable to let others know that the commit may not have been done by you.

## Sending Encrypted Emails

This is what `gpg` is known for, encrypting emails. Although I fail to see how encrypted emails can
be useful in this day and age[^3], the process is still interesting.

```
$ gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r recipient@email.com file
```

As you may have noticed, we are encrypting *AND* signing `file`. The encryption happens using the
public key of `recipient@email.com`, the intended recipient. This ensures only he can decrypt it
using his private key. However, simply encrypting the message doesn't let the recipient know the
identity of the person who sent `file`. By signing the encrypted `file` with your private key, you
ensure that the recipient can verify your identity and know that it was really you who sent `file`.

You may not have realized it but if you delete the original `file`, you have no way to decrypt
`file.asc` and confirm what you sent to the recipient. This may or may not be intended.[^5] If it
isn't, add yourself to the list of recipients as well.

```
$ gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r recipient@email.com -r johndoe@gmail.com file
```

When you decrypt the file using your private key, you'll see something like this

```
$ gpg --decrypt file.asc
gpg: encrypted with 255-bit ECDH key, ID 56FD80B33EC30FC0, created 2021-06-17
      "Recipient <recipent@email.com>"
gpg: encrypted with 255-bit ECDH key, ID 33C9FD3263EA96F4, created 2021-11-03
      "John Doe <johndoe@gmail.com>"
These are the contents
of the file that was
encrypted and signed
using gpg
gpg: Signature made Monday 15 November 2021 09:10:40 PM IST
gpg:                using EDDSA key DFA1BED2A6BDCAE4BE9AD8AE88A8EF325FCA2F7F
gpg:                issuer "johndoe@gmail.com"
gpg: Good signature from "John Doe <johndoe@gmail.com>" [ultimate]
```

## Package Management

Remember how we talked about `C` always being the master key pair and how it's used to sign the
public key of others? This is where the concept of **Web of Trust** comes in.

Even if you do download a public key pair from a key server, how do you ensure that that key really
does belong to the person who you're thinking of? You could rely on the person publishing that key
on his own website (which is pretty reasonable in most cases, I think). However, what if potentially
thousands of people depend on the authenticity of that key?

Let's say you trust Snowden's public key which is `A11CDB599CB2FEAD`[^6]. You have personally
verified that this key belongs to him. If Snowden ends up signing Laura's public key, which is
`69D0EA9C2C10B685`, you can have some level of trust that `69D0EA9C2C10B685` really does belong to
Laura. If more people you trust end up signing Laura's key, the premise that `69D0EA9C2C10B685`
belongs to Laura becomes stronger. This ensures that if Laura ever sends you a signed message, you
can be sure that it really was Laura and not an imposter with the same UID, which can be easily
impersonated.

This is somewhat similar to the decentralized nature of BitTorrent. The members of a swarm exchange
data with each other. In the case of Web of Trust, people exchange trust among each other by signing
each other's keys. This is how the developers and package maintainers of projects like Arch Linux
establish trust, even among themselves, while maintaining and distributing packages to thousands of
people. [This page](https://archlinux.org/master-keys/) should give you an idea of how Web of Trust
works in real life. There's also [signing
parties](https://salsa.debian.org/signing-party-team/signing-party) where [people
meet](https://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning/Need) and sign each other's keys.

When you think about it, Web of Trust is really a decentralized alternative to the hierarchical
public key infrastructure of centralized certificate authorities that we're usually familiar with in
the case of TLS. Instead of trusting a certificate authority, we trust people we know. I know this
sounds good in theory but Web of Trust hasn't seen much adoption, probably because of its somewhat
esoteric nature.

# The Problems With GPG

Unfortunately, as of version 2.2.29, the `gpg --gen-key` command, which should be user friendly,
ends up creating a 3072 bit RSA key pair[^7]. Even when we use `gpg --full-gen-key`, we're presented
with the following menu

```
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection?
```

It is only when we execute `gpg --expert --full-gen-key`, we finally get the option to generate ECC
keys

```
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
   (9) ECC and ECC
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (13) Existing key
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 9
```

What's even funnier is the description of the `--expert` option in the `gpg` man page

> Allow  the  user to do certain nonsensical or "silly" things like signing an expired or revoked
> key, or certain potentially incompatible things like generating unusual key types. This also
> disables certain warning messages about potentially incompatible actions. As the name implies,
> this option is for experts only. If you don't fully understand the implications of what it allows
> you to do, leave this off. --no-expert disables this option.

After you select the 9th option, you get a list of curves to choose from, some of which are
apparently [unsafe](https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/).

```
Please select which elliptic curve you want:
   (1) Curve 25519
   (3) NIST P-256
   (4) NIST P-384
   (5) NIST P-521
   (6) Brainpool P-256
   (7) Brainpool P-384
   (8) Brainpool P-512
   (9) secp256k1
Your selection? 1
```

Basically, `gpg` ends up discouraging the use of ECC keys in 2021 when modern projects like
WireGuard support ONLY elliptic curves like Curve25519 for key exchange. I don't think it'd be
unfair to say that the user experience of GPG needs a revamp. I haven't even scratched the surface
of the problems that `gpg` has but I'm not surprised why [some
people](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/) [abhor
GPG](https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp/).

# Alternatives To GPG

## `signify` and `minisign`

I really like how OpenBSD comes up with projects like [doas](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/doas)
and [mandoc](https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan18-mandoc.pdf), minimal projects that work well.
I've personally replaced `sudo` with `doas` and `man-db` with `mandoc` on my Linux installation.
It's no surprise that they came up with their own alternative to `gpg`, which they call
[signify](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/signify). I really liked this part,

> The one and only supported algorithm is Ed25519.

The man page of `signify` is just a single page.

We'll go ahead and create two sets of key pairs,

```
$ signify -G -c "Edward Snowden" -p "snowden.pub" -s "snowden.sec"
$ signify -G -c "Laura Poitras" -p "laura.pub" -s "laura.sec"
$ ll *.{sec,pub}
.rw-r----- 101 user user 16 Nov 00:33 laura.pub
.rw------- 185 user user 16 Nov 00:33 laura.sec
.rw-r----- 102 user user 16 Nov 00:33 snowden.pub
.rw------- 186 user user 16 Nov 00:33 snowden.sec
$ cat *.pub
untrusted comment: Laura Poitras public key
RWTu9jBOro7hEGLex5xMU8xThaPFm0XzKc9lQTA1TCSqt/ko3vY5XUK1
untrusted comment: Edward Snowden public key
RWRdq5HECyfO2Of2fOhvEzAnMFsSaSKHCqZAhphqQdEmZKozgSvg3L5c
```

The `untrusted comment` part might seem weird but this is apparently meant to prevent people just
glancing over the comment and not verifying the actual signature.

The process of signing and verifying is simple.

```
[snowden@laptop ~]$ signify -S -s snowden.sec -m .Xresources
[snowden@laptop ~]$ cat .Xresources.sig
untrusted comment: verify with snowden.pub
RWRdq5HECyfO2E0/s5ieb9NO/m3jvbR9a1NH/dlIPLdHSzkXVwdZrYgww1zuhQG1/2PtpBap7+kVwOsJrWI4wk7tnEolk+SWQAo=

[laura@desktop ~]$ signify -V -p snowden.pub -m .Xresources
Signature Verified
```

In case you're still thinking, what if someone modifies the `.Xresources` file in transit? If they
do,

```
[laura@desktop ~]$ signify -V -p snowden.pub -m .Xresources
signify: signature verification failed
```

From what I understand after reading about ED25519[^8], the generated signature involves the usage
of a cryptographic hash function, SHA-512 in this case, on the message. When the signature is
decrypted using the public key, the integrity of the message is verified as well.

The keys don't expire by default but in the case of OpenBSD, each key is used only for a single
release. After that, a new key is used and this key is already included in the previous release. Ted
calls this ["implicit signing"](https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html) and is skeptical
about key revocation. This takes me back to the [SSH certificates
article](../ssh/ssh-certificates.md) and how the issue of short lived certificates comes up. In
addition, `signify` doesn't rely on any sort of web of trust. They just plaster their public keys
all over the place.

I doubt cryptographic signing could get any simpler. This tool could be easily used with scripts as
well to sign and verify files.

Just like `signify`, [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) uses only Curve25519, nothing
else. The man page of `minisign` seems eerily similar to `signify`'s man page with a few
improvements such as a trusted comment which can't be modified without the secret key. A signed file
looks like

```
untrusted comment: Laura Poitras
RURchBrOVL4550MwwKanNkaHTXPS/NGTfQTwY8eZ2eS/sfiMAbTOybioO82htV03kXpxpl5+y0t4K8YeAcl/R7luP66SyHi6mwg=
trusted comment: timestamp:1637006398	file:.Xresources	hashed
MUyLZDpuWr0kisOlSz1WXoz66G3KBUnCX7Gt83v2DONpWJDueVglLYEbtqVtb3zf/qXtfNAdgf2sQk1ZoNwuCg==
```

I'm not entirely sure about the purpose of a trusted comment.

The major issue with these tools is the absence of adoption and a lack of ecosystem. You can neither
sign your git commits nor establish any sort of web of trust with them. Of course, some people have
called web of trust a failure but they're subjective opinions. Ultimately, these aspects might be
important for people who do end up using public key cryptography in some form.

## `age`

[age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) is a delightfully simple tool for encrypting data. It
supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Just like `signify`, it uses Curve25519 by default.

```
$ age-keygen | age --armor -p > secret.key
Public key: age1cs0g6jjefgasdwj2m6p29x0na07xaseryzdst50lrn3smxtts4rq262w4u
Enter passphrase (leave empty to autogenerate a secure one):
Confirm passphrase:
```

The `age-keygen` command doesn't offer to encrypt the secret key but it can be done by piping the
secret key to age's symmetric encryption option. One of the best things about age is its ability to
use SSH keys for asymmetric encryption.

```
$ age --armor -R ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub .Xresources > .Xresources.age
[recipient@laptop ~]$ age -d -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 .Xresources.age > .Xresources.dec
```

You could do this with `openssl` as well but I find `age` much more pleasant to use. You could even
encrypt messages using the SSH public key of someone you know on GitHub.

```
$ curl https://github.com/user.keys | age -R - .Xresources > .Xresources.age
```

I'd love to see projects use `age` and `signify`/`minisign` in combination to encrypt and sign data.
I wonder if [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) could use `age` instead of `gpg` for encrypting
the password store.

## `ssh`

Yes, `ssh` can be used to encrypt and sign arbitrary data, which sounds too good to be true,
considering `ssh` has the most widespread adoption out of all the tools we've seen so far, even
`gpg`.

We've already seen how SSH keys can be used for asymmetric encryption using `age`. To sign arbitrary
data,

```
$ ssh-keygen -Y sign -f ~/.ssh/id_25519 -n "file" .Xresources
Signing file .Xresources
Write signature to .Xresources.sig
```

Unfortunately, verifying signatures requires maintenance of an `allowed_signers` file with entries
to mapping emails/identities to public keys. This overhead can be offset using SSH certificates but
that may not be feasible.

SSH keys also gained support to sign git commits and tags in [version
2.34](https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq8rxpgwki.fsf@gitster.g/). Hopefully, this should drive even
more adoption towards `ssh`.
