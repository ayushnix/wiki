???+ quote "Eren Yeager (Shingeki no Kyojin, Volume 24, Chapter 97)"
     Every day I'm here, I think: Why did it ever come to this? Damaged minds and bodies ... their
     freedom taken away ... even losing themselves. If people knew it would come to this, nobody
     would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That
     "something" wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push
     their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might
     be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.

???+ quote "2B (NieR:Automata)"
     Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped ... in a never-ending
     spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the
     god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle ... and wonder if we'll ever have the chance to
     kill him.

???+ quote "Makunouchi Ippo (Hajime no Ippo, Chapter 1241)"
     Not everyone who puts in effort is rewarded in life. But, those who succeed are always those
     who put in effort.

???+ quote "Takamura Mamoru (Hajime no Ippo, Chapter 1349)"
     If you've got something you want to accomplish with the rest of your life, the one who's gonna
     grant your wishes isn't the gods. It's yourself. The only one who can do what you want to do -
     is you.
