???+ quote "Eren Yeager (Shingeki no Kyojin, Volume 24, Chapter 97)"
     Every day I'm here, I think: Why did it ever come to this? Damaged minds and bodies ... their
     freedom taken away ... even losing themselves. If people knew it would come to this, nobody
     would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That
     "something" wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push
     their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might
     be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.

???+ quote "2B (NieR:Automata)"
     Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped ... in a never-ending
     spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the
     god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle ... and wonder if we'll ever have the chance to
     kill him.

???+ quote "Makunouchi Ippo (Hajime no Ippo, Chapter 1241)"
     Not everyone who puts in effort is rewarded in life. But, those who succeed are always those
     who put in effort.

???+ quote "Takamura Mamoru (Hajime no Ippo, Chapter 1349)"
     If you've got something you want to accomplish with the rest of your life, the one who's gonna
     grant your wishes isn't the gods. It's yourself. The only one who can do what you want to do -
     is you.

???+ quote "Javik (Mass Effect 3)"
     Stand in the ashes of a trillion dead souls, and ask the ghosts if honor matters. The silence
     is your answer.

???+ quote "Mathematics: Its Contents, Methods and Meaning Part 1"
     An adequate presentation of any science cannot consist of detailed information alone, however
     extensive. It must also provide a proper view of the essential nature of the science as a
     whole.

???+ quote "Edward Snowden"
     Nobody needs to justify why they "need" a right: the burden of justification falls on the one
     seeking to infringe upon the right.[^1]

???+ quote "Edward Snowden"
     Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no
     different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.[^1]

???+ quote "Edward Snowden"
     They recognize that even if we had a 9/11 attack every year, we would still be losing more
     people to car accidents and heart disease, and we donâ€™t see the same expenditure of resources
     to respond to those more significant threats.[^2]

???+ quote "Garry Kasparov"
     You can get quite far in a democracy if you can convince a majority that they are victims of a
     minority, and that only you can protect them.[^3]
