Every day I'm here, I think: Why did it ever come to this? Damaged minds and bodies ... their
freedom taken away ... even losing themselves. If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go
to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That "something" wasn't
their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a
different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be
another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.

        - Eren Yeager (Shingeki no Kyojin, Volume 24, Chapter 97)
